# Hill Climbing Image Reconstructor

An image reconstructor that recreates a target image using a steepest-ascent hill climbing algorithm with procedural ellipses.

---

## Features

- Hill climbing optimization for image similarity  
- Procedural shape-based (ellipse) image generation  
- Pixel-accurate fitness calculation using raw image data  
- SFML 3.0 rendering for visual output  

---

## How It Works

The algorithm starts with a blank canvas and adds random translucent ellipses one at a time. At each iteration:

1. A new ellipse is randomly mutated  
2. It is rendered onto a copy of the current output buffer  
3. The result is compared to the target image using a pixel-wise fitness function  
4. If the fitness improves, the new ellipse is accepted and committed  

This process continues until the desired runtime or quality is achieved.

## Dependencies
- SFML 3.0 (make sure to install it via your package manager)
- CMake â‰¥ 3.20  
- C++23-compatible compiler  
- Linux distribution that supports sfml 3.0
